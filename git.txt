#We will talk now about the **git push command. !! Notice that before making a git push you have to make the **git add and the **git commit to make your unpushed files ready to be uploaded
#Here is how to use the **git push command

$git push origin branchName <--! $git push orgin master -->

#To recommit a filename that has already been added use

$git commit -a -m "any description you want to add" <--! The -a parameter makes this possible but it is only used on files that have already been added via the $git add command-->



##To remove a file in the github repository

$git rm filename.ext or $git rm --cached filename.ext

_To remove all files run_ git rm --cached -r .
